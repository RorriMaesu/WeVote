# WeVote — Draft. Debate. Decide.

<!-- ============================================= -->
## Ultra‑Brief FB Ad Variant Bank (High-Conversion Focus)
*(Keep ads concise: Primary Text ≤110 chars, Headline ≤40, Description ≤30. Rotate & A/B test.)*

| Variant | Primary Text (Feed) | Headline | Description | Psychological Levers |
|---------|---------------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| A | Turn concern → verifiable vote. Your receipt proves it. | Verify Your Voice | Try the beta today | Proof, empowerment |
| B | Draft policy with transparent AI + cryptographic vote receipts. | Trust the Process | See receipts live | Transparency, novelty |
| C | Opaque polls? WeVote gives you a receipt + public tally link. | Receipts For Votes | Audit instantly | Loss aversion (missing proof) |
| D | Early builders wanted: help shape open civic voting. | Help Build WeVote | Contribute + vote | Identity, co‑creation |
| E | Your idea. Open draft. Public tally. Verifiable receipt. | Make It Count | Beta access open | Completion, clarity |
| F | Not another hot take feed—evidence + verifiable outcomes. | From Noise to Votes | See how it works | Contrast, differentiation |
| G | See a live hash‑chained tally; then post your own concern. | Audit Then Act | Test the ledger | Curiosity, sequence |
| H | Fuel open civic tech: try WeVote & back model costs. | Support & Participate | Small boosts matter | Reciprocity, mission |

**Recommended Creative Pairings**
- Image 1: UI screenshot of receipt verification (blur personal data).  
- Image 2 (carousel): Draft → Ballot → Ledger sequence (narrative arc).  
- Short Video (6–8s): Concern title typing → “Generate drafts” → receipt code flash.

**Copy Components (Mix & Match)**
- Opening micro-hooks: "Concern → Receipt", "Audit then act", "Draft. Verify. Vote."  
- Benefit compressions: "Cryptographic receipts", "Transparent AI prompts", "Hash‑chained tallies".  
- Soft social proof: "Open beta contributors already verifying tallies" (avoid inflated metrics).  
- Subliminal frames (ethical): Shift from chaos → clarity; from shouting → structured iteration.

**Donation Soft Insert (Optional Line After CTA)**  
“Buy a coffee = one more verified drafting session.” (Pairs mission with tangible micro‑impact.)

**Policy Guardrails**
- Avoid: Personal attribute targeting ("people like you"), exaggerated claims, political persuasion wording that implies election influence.  
- Use neutral civic framing: "platform", "beta", "open source", "verifiable".  
- Keep emojis minimal (≤1) to maintain seriousness & trust (we recommend none for ledger/tally angles).

**Rapid Testing Plan (Suggested)**
1. Week 1: Test A vs C (receipt framing) – optimize CTR.  
2. Week 2: Winner vs D (contributor angle) – optimize qualified signups (on‑site engagement >30s).  
3. Week 3: Add H with soft support line – measure add‑on donation clicks.  
4. Retire underperformers (<0.75x median CTR after 1k impressions).  

**Pixel / Tracking Suggestions**
- UTM template: `?utm_source=fb&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=beta_<variant>` (replace `<variant>` with letter).  
- Custom events: `draft_start`, `ballot_open`, `receipt_view`, `donation_click` (fire after user intent, not page load).  

**One-Line Retargeting Prompt**  
“You opened a concern—finish it with a verifiable tally.” (Trigger after `draft_start` without `ballot_open` in 3 days.)

**A trustworthy, auditable public square where people co‑create policy ideas, refine them with transparent AI assistance, and cast verifiable votes.**

---
## Headline / Hook
Democracy feels distant. WeVote turns civic insight into action with cryptographic receipts, transparent AI prompts, and a public audit trail you can actually inspect.

> "If Wikipedia, open source, and civic town halls had a child — it would look like this."  *(Early tester)*

---
## The Core Problem
Traditional comment threads fragment, decisions disappear into black boxes, and civic tech often asks for blind trust. People want:
- Clarity instead of chaos.
- Verifiable tallies instead of opaque outcomes.
- Constructive iteration instead of outrage loops.

---
## What WeVote Delivers (Today)
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Vote Receipts** – Every vote produces a deterministic receipt code you can later verify.
- 🔍 **Transparency Ledger** – An append‑only hash chain for tallies; no silent edits.
- 🧠 **Prompt‑Provenanced Drafting** – LLM assistance with hashed prompt + response metadata (no opaque magic).
- 🗳️ **Multiple Voting Methods** – Simple, approval, ranked-choice (RCV) with deterministic tie resolution.
- 🧪 **Rate‑Limited, Abuse‑Aware Chat** – Guardrails & moderation heuristics keep debate productive.

---
## Coming Next (You Can Influence This)
1. Public audit mirror with redacted but real-time oversight data.
2. Retrieval‑augmented drafting (cited model summaries over trusted sources).
3. Delegated / weighted trust layers for reputation‑aware tallies.
4. Streaming assistant responses + side‑by‑side revision diffing.
5. Reviewer credibility signals affecting feed ranking.

If these excite you: help build them.

---
## Why Join Early
Early contributors shape core invariants (data schemas, trust flows, moderation rubric). We deliberately keep scope sharp now so architectural rigor wins over feature bloat.

---
## Call To Action (User)
1. Visit the live beta: **https://wevote-5400a.firebaseapp.com**
2. Create a concern you care about.
3. Generate draft proposals. Refine with feedback.
4. Open a ballot and share the receipt verification page with friends.
5. Inspect the transparency section — verify a ledger link yourself.

---
## Call To Action (Contributor)
We are assembling a small, high‑trust contributor circle:
- TypeScript / Firebase engineers (functions, security rules, rate limit patterns)
- UX / accessibility polishers (mobile ergonomics, focus management)
- Trust & Safety / moderation designers
- Civic process researchers (deliberation frameworks)
- Cryptography & verification enthusiasts

**How to raise your hand:**
Open a GitHub issue titled `Contributor Interest: <Skill>` with:
- What motivates you
- Relevant lightweight example (repo link or gist)
- One suggestion to tighten trust or transparency

We use issues to triage & invite you into focused roadmap threads.

## Subtle Fuel (Optional Support)
If you believe in accelerating verifiable, open civic tooling and want to offset hosting + model inference costs, you can quietly boost progress here:

[Support development (Buy Me a Coffee)](https://buymeacoffee.com/rorrimaesu)

Every small boost goes straight into:
- LLM inference + safety evaluation credits
- Load testing & emulator environments
- Signature / KMS operations & security hardening

(If you can’t contribute financially, forwarding the project to one civic‑minded friend is equally powerful.)

## Creative / Asset Notes (For Facebook Ad Setup)
- Primary Image: Clean UI screenshot focusing on a ballot view + receipt verification snippet.
- Secondary Carousel (optional): Draft generation panel, ledger entry detail, receipt verification page.
- CTA Button: "Sign Up" or "Learn More" (avoid over‑promising language per platform policy).
- Body Copy Character Discipline: Keep under 90 chars for mobile truncation friendliness.

---
## Compliance & Tone Guardrails
