# WeVote — Draft. Debate. Decide.

**A trustworthy, auditable public square where people co‑create policy ideas, refine them with transparent AI assistance, and cast verifiable votes.**

---
## Headline / Hook
Democracy feels distant. WeVote turns civic insight into action with cryptographic receipts, transparent AI prompts, and a public audit trail you can actually inspect.

> "If Wikipedia, open source, and civic town halls had a child — it would look like this."  *(Early tester)*

---
## The Core Problem
Traditional comment threads fragment, decisions disappear into black boxes, and civic tech often asks for blind trust. People want:
- Clarity instead of chaos.
- Verifiable tallies instead of opaque outcomes.
- Constructive iteration instead of outrage loops.

---
## What WeVote Delivers (Today)
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Vote Receipts** – Every vote produces a deterministic receipt code you can later verify.
- 🔍 **Transparency Ledger** – An append‑only hash chain for tallies; no silent edits.
- 🧠 **Prompt‑Provenanced Drafting** – LLM assistance with hashed prompt + response metadata (no opaque magic).
- 🗳️ **Multiple Voting Methods** – Simple, approval, ranked-choice (RCV) with deterministic tie resolution.
- 🧪 **Rate‑Limited, Abuse‑Aware Chat** – Guardrails & moderation heuristics keep debate productive.

## Coming Next (You Can Influence This)
1. Public audit mirror with redacted but real-time oversight data.
2. Retrieval‑augmented drafting (cited model summaries over trusted sources).
3. Delegated / weighted trust layers for reputation‑aware tallies.
4. Streaming assistant responses + side‑by‑side revision diffing.
5. Reviewer credibility signals affecting feed ranking.

If these excite you: help build them.

## Why Join Early
Early contributors shape core invariants (data schemas, trust flows, moderation rubric). We deliberately keep scope sharp now so architectural rigor wins over feature bloat.

---
## Call To Action (User)
1. Visit the live beta: **https://wevote-5400a.firebaseapp.com**
2. Create a concern you care about.
3. Generate draft proposals. Refine with feedback.
4. Open a ballot and share the receipt verification page with friends.
5. Inspect the transparency section — verify a ledger link yourself.

---
## Call To Action (Contributor)
We are assembling a small, high‑trust contributor circle:
- TypeScript / Firebase engineers (functions, security rules, rate limit patterns)
- UX / accessibility polishers (mobile ergonomics, focus management)
- Trust & Safety / moderation designers
- Civic process researchers (deliberation frameworks)
- Cryptography & verification enthusiasts

**How to raise your hand:**
Open a GitHub issue titled `Contributor Interest: <Skill>` with:
- What motivates you
- Relevant lightweight example (repo link or gist)
- One suggestion to tighten trust or transparency

We use issues to triage & invite you into focused roadmap threads.

## Subtle Fuel (Optional Support)
If you believe in accelerating verifiable, open civic tooling and want to offset hosting + model inference costs, you can quietly boost progress here:

[Support development (Buy Me a Coffee)](https://buymeacoffee.com/rorrimaesu)

Every small boost goes straight into:
- LLM inference + safety evaluation credits
- Load testing & emulator environments
- Signature / KMS operations & security hardening

(If you can’t contribute financially, forwarding the project to one civic‑minded friend is equally powerful.)

## Shareable Ad Variation Snippets
**Version A (Discovery)**  
"Civic ideas shouldn’t vanish in comment threads. On WeVote you draft proposals with transparent AI assist and cast verifiable votes. Try the beta – then tell us what to build next."

**Version B (Verification Angle)**  
"Ever wished you could audit a public vote? Now you can. Cryptographic receipts + hash‑chained tallies. Be an early tester — help shape the trust layer."

**Version C (Contributor Appeal)**  
"Open source civic stack: AI‑aided drafting, ranked ballots, real transparency ledger. We’re shipping fast — looking for sharp TypeScript & policy minds."

## Creative / Asset Notes (For Facebook Ad Setup)
- Primary Image: Clean UI screenshot focusing on a ballot view + receipt verification snippet.
- Secondary Carousel (optional): Draft generation panel, ledger entry detail, receipt verification page.
- CTA Button: "Sign Up" or "Learn More" (avoid over‑promising language per platform policy).
- Body Copy Character Discipline: Keep under 90 chars for mobile truncation friendliness.

---
## Compliance & Tone Guardrails
- Avoid implying guaranteed political impact; position as a civic experimentation platform.
- No personal attribute targeting language ("people like you") in ads.
- Emphasize verification & transparency vs. partisan advantage.
