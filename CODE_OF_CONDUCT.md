# Code of Conduct

We follow a concise, good‑faith participation guideline:

1. Act with integrity and respect. Disagreement is fine; harassment is not.
2. No discrimination, hate speech, or personal attacks.
3. Provide constructive feedback—focus on the code, architecture, and security posture.
4. Do not introduce libraries or patterns that compromise verifiability or auditability without discussion.
5. Respect responsible disclosure requests and embargoes.

The project maintainer may warn, temporarily block, or ban contributors violating these rules. Severe violations may result in immediate removal from collaboration.

For conduct concerns, contact the maintainer (@RorriMaesu) privately.

By contributing, you agree to this Code of Conduct.
